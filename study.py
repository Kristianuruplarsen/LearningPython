         ["What might pre-analysis plans help with? What are they?", "3","Pre-analysis plans are project descriptions which are prepared before researchers begin their study. They contain information on the hypotheses researchers plan to investigate, and how they will go about it. Their purpose is to restrict the freedom given to researchers in teasing out significant results from their data, thus preventing p-hacking (intentional or not) as well as other kinds of evidence fabrication."],

Thus we need to devise of a good way to limit our inclusion of additional parameters in the models."],

The question of parternalism has become relevant in the context of BE as research indicates that individuals are not always rational and/or behaving optimally. This poses the question of whether policy makers should govern people to make rational choices, which is contrary to the economic belief that individuals are free and acts in the best way possible themselves. A proposed answer to this quetion is libertarian paternalism."],

If nudging requires the implementation of secondary regulation (i.e. if we want to nudge people into getting health insurance, we also have to specify what is acceptable as a health insurance policy, and so on) it might actually decrease efficiency."],
         ["Name some benefits of libertarian paternalism","3","1) systematic deviations from efficiency are costly to society, 2) it is less invasive than alternative policies, 3) In many cases it is necessary to specify a default anyways, so we might as well make the default the optimal one and 4) people make choices with or without nudging"],
